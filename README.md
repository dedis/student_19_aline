# student_19_aline

This project consists of, first, writing a smart contract in Go that communicates with cothority and secondly, writing a plugin that uses this smart contract to allow Internet users to certify some webpage content. The name of this plugin is 
**ALINE**, standing for **A**ttestation that on**line** content existed.

- The smart contract can be found at this path : `cothority_webpage_contract` -> `byzcoin` -> `webpage.go` (and its corresponding attributes and test files, `proto.go` and `webpage_test.go` respectively)
- The plugin, a Chrome extension, can be found in the folder named `ALINE`.
